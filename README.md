# KDRE: Robust Cross-lingual Knowledge Base Question Answering via Knowledge Distillation 
All of these documents are data which used in the study "Robust Cross-lingual Knowledge Base Question Answering via Knowledge Distillation" <br>
These documents contains the following files: <br>
* Translated training questions
* Back-translated training questions
* Translated validation questions
* Translated testing questions
* Information about the original English questions

# Translated training questions
This file contains the translated training questions.<br>
These questions in different languages other than English are used to translated to English to construct training set for the student model.<br>
         
# Back-translated training questions 
This file mainly contains the back-translated training questions.<br>
Back-translation means the English questions are first translated to other different languages, and then are translated to English.<br>
The back-translated questions are used in the training procedure by the student model.<br>

# Translated validation questions
This file contains the translated validation questions.<br>

# Translated testing questions
The English testing questions are translated to different languages which are used in the test procedure by the student model.<br>

# Original questions
The original English questions are drieved from the standard dataset SimpleQuestions. <br>
